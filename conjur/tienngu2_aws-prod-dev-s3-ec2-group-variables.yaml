# This policy is using a group that includes all the variables and then grant permissions to that group.
# A !group called aws_resources that includes all the variables. We then grant this group to the variables and define a single !permit statement that grants the read, update, and execute privileges to both layers for the entire group.
# This is a conceptual example. Conjur does not support granting a group to variables or using a group as a resource in a permit statement in this manner.
# The correct approach is to define individual permit statements for each variable. This ensures that each resource has explicit and granular permissions as required by Conjur's security model.
# 
# Breakdown of the policy
# !policy: This is the root policy with the ID aws_integration. It serves as the container for all the resources and permissions related to AWS integration within Conjur.
# !layer: Two layers are defined to group access control for different environments or purposes. aws_prod_access: This layer is intended for production access control. aws_dev_access: This layer is intended for development access control.
# !host: Two hosts are defined, representing different entities such as services or machines. prod_host: A host that likely represents a production server or service. dev_host: A host that likely represents a development server or service.
# !grant: These statements associate each host with a corresponding layer. The first grant associates prod_host with the aws_prod_access layer. The second grant associates dev_host with the aws_dev_access layer.
# !policy: Sub-policies are defined for managing secrets related to specific AWS resources. 
#      s3_buckets: A sub-policy for managing secrets related to S3 buckets.
#         !variable: Variables within this sub-policy store the S3 bucket access key and secret key. 
#     ec2_instances: A sub-policy for managing secrets related to EC2 instances.
#         !variable: Variables within this sub-policy store the EC2 instance access key and secret key.
# !group: A group called aws_resources is defined to include all the variables from the sub-policies. This group is intended to simplify permission management by grouping all AWS-related secrets.
# !grant: This statement grants the aws_resources group permission to the variables defined in the sub-policies. The members of the group are the variables for the S3 bucket access key, S3 bucket secret key, EC2 instance access key, and EC2 instance secret key.
# !permit: A single permit statement grants specified privileges to both the aws_prod_access and aws_dev_access layers for the group that includes all variables.
#     The roles are the two layers, and the privileges granted are read, update, and execute.
#     The resource is the aws_resources group, which includes all the variables.
